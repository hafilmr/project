# Comparative Algoritma in Sentiment Analysist
Sentiment Analysist | Comparative Algoritma
============================================================
This project discusses the application of several algorithms to compare the results of their accuracy in sentiment analysis research.

The dataset used is about cellular services from twitter. The algorithm used is:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Linear SVC
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

The results of this comparison can be used as a consideration for the use of sentiment analysis algorithms. Parameters in each algorithm are defaulted to get the best results without changing the input parameter values.

GridSearch or RandomSearch can be a method to get the best accuracy results for each algorithm used by utilizing the best input parameter values.
